        <p>
            Welcome to Habit, a bingo-like game to help kids develop good habits.
            It's a weekly sticker-chart that encourages kids to do their chores, homework, and other tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each letter/column has a theme, like "sleep", "eating", "sharing", etc... with a simple task to do, like
            "Try a new food", "Share a toy", "Brush teeth twice a day", etc... Kids get one sticker a day for each task
            they complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to complete a row, column, or diagonal, and get a prize (prize provided by you üòÅ).
        </p>

            That card is styled to hopefully fill/print on a single page. Try and print the page, and check the preview.
